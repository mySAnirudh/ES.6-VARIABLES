A variable, by definition, is “a named space in the memory” that stores values. In other 
words, it acts as a container for values in a program. Variable names are called 
identifiers. Following are the naming rules for an identifier:
 Identifiers cannot be keywords.
 Identifiers can contain alphabets and numbers.
 Identifiers cannot contain spaces and special characters, except the underscore (_) 
and the dollar ($) sign.
 Variable names cannot begin with a number.
Type Syntax
A variable must be declared before it is used. ES5 syntax used the var keyword to achieve 
the same. The ES5 syntax for declaring a variable is as follows.
//Declaration using var keyword
var variable_name
ES6 introduces the following variable declaration syntax: 
 Using the let
 Using the const
Variable initialization refers to the process of storing a value in the variable. A variable 
may be initialized either at the time of its declaration or at a later point in time.
The traditional ES5 type syntax for declaring and initializing a variable is as follows:
//Declaration using var keyword
var variable_name=value
Example: Using Variables 
var name="Tom"
console.log("The value in the variable is: "+name);
The above example declares a variable and prints its value.
The following output is displayed on successful execution.
The value in the variable is Tom
